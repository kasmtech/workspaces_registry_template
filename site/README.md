This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## New schema version

If a new schema version comes out, this is what you will need to do.

1. Create a new branch with the schema version as the branch name (for example, 1.1)
1. Open `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml` and change the on: push: branches: to match the new version:
```
on:
  push:
    branches: [ 1.1 ]
```
then at the bottom of the file change the `target-folder` to match the version `target-folder: "1.1"`
1. Open `site/next.config.js` and change `env.schema` to match the version number, add the version number to the `env.listUrl` and append the version number to the `basePath` as well.
